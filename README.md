### Agentic-Research-Assistant

This assistant is built on a curated dataset of papers from arXiv, the worldâ€™s largest and most widely used open-access repository for scientific research in fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning, mathematics, and physics. arXiv serves as the first stop for many groundbreaking ideas, often hosting preprints months before they are peer-reviewed or published at top conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL. To enable intelligent interaction with this vast body of knowledge, the project uses a dataset (ai-arxiv2-chunks) in which arXiv papers are preprocessed into semantically meaningful chunksâ€”optimized for language model understanding and fast vector-based search. Each chunk includes rich metadata such as titles, abstracts, authors, categories, and DOIs, making it possible to ground user queries in real scientific content. This foundation allows users to explore papers by topic, summarize emerging trends, compare methodologies, or extract technical insights without reading entire documents. By integrating arXiv into a conversational interface powered by LangChain and OpenAI, the assistant becomes a powerful research companionâ€”ideal for students, academics, engineers, and anyone working with deep, domain-specific knowledge.

Reading through long papers, technical specs, or online resources is time-consuming. Even with CTRL+F and traditional search, weâ€™re limited to matching exact terms. This assistant goes further by **understanding** the context and returning **insightful, synthesized responses** to natural language questions.

Whether you're conducting a literature review or researching a startup ecosystem, this tool allows you to:

- Ask questions across multiple documents.
- Receive accurate, summarized answers with context.
- Avoid manually scanning dense material.
- Interact with content like a conversation, not a chore.
