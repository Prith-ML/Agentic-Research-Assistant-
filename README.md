Reading through long papers, technical specs, or online resources is time-consuming. Even with CTRL+F and traditional search, weâ€™re limited to matching exact terms. This assistant goes further by **understanding** the context and returning **insightful, synthesized responses** to natural language questions.

Whether you're conducting a literature review or researching a startup ecosystem, this tool allows you to:

- Ask questions across multiple documents.
- Receive accurate, summarized answers with context.
- Avoid manually scanning dense material.
- Interact with content like a conversation, not a chore.
